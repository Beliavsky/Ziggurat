# Ziggurat
Generate uniform, normal, and exponential random deviates using algorithms from Marsaglia, based on Alan Miller's ziggurat.f90. Compile with ```gfortran ziggurat.f90 xzig.f90``` . Compile with ```gfortran ziggurat_pure.f90 xzig_pure.f90``` to demonstrate the generation of random uniform and random 32-bit integers by pure subroutines. Codes also work with Intel Fortran, flang, and g95.
